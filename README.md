Cucumber Sync synchronizes contacts and calendars securely between your Android devices and the desktop.

When you sign up for a Cucumber Sync account on an your Android device contacts and calendars saved using Cucumber Sync will be synchronised with the server. To synchronise your data to other devices just sign in to your Cucumber Sync account.

Cucumber Sync uses end-to-end encryption ensuring your data remains private, even from us. All data stored on the server is encrypted with a key that only you have, meaning that your data is always secure even from a court ordered warrant.

In addition to contacts and calendars, notes, todos, photos and files are on the roadmap. For more information, please see the [project site](https://github.com/nickel-chrome/CucumberSync) hosted on GitHub.
