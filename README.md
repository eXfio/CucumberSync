Cucumber Sync is an Android 4+ sync provider that syncs Personal Information Management data Securely (PIMS, like the drink), i.e. contacts and calendars. Cucumber Sync uses a self-hosted Mozilla Sync (aka Firefox Sync) server as the back end. Just add a Cucumber Sync account using your Firefox Sync credentials and contacts saved using the Cucumber Sync Contacts Provider will be synchronised with the server. Add the Cucumber Sync account to additional devices to synchronise contacts across multiple devices securely.
