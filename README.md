Cucumber Sync is an Android 4+ sync provider that syncs Personal Information Management data Securely (PIMS, like the drink), i.e. contacts and calendars. Cucumber Sync uses a self-hosted Mozilla Sync (aka Firefox Sync) server as the back end, just add a Cucumber Sync account using your Firefox Sync credentials and contacts and calendars saved using Cucumber Sync will be synchronised with the server. Add a Cucumber Sync account to additional devices to synchronise contacts and calendars across multiple devices. Cucumber Sync uses end-to-end encryption ensuring your data remains confidentiality even from the server.
