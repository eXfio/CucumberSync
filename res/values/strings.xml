		<p>Thank you for buying Cucumber Sync via Google Play and thus supporting the project. Unfortunately, there are two issues with Google Play:</p>
		
		<h2>1. Accounts may be gone after a reboot</h2>
		<p>You may encounter the problem that all your <strong>Cucumber Sync accounts (including contacts and events) are gone
        after rebooting your device</strong>. The reason is a <a href="https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=34880">bug in Android</a>
        that causes accounts of paid apps to be removed on start-up because the (encrypted) APK files are
        loaded <i>after</i> checking for orphaned accounts.</p>
        <p>Affected users:<br/>
        * all Android 4.1 users who have got Cucumber Sync from Play Store;<br/>
        * Android 4.2 users who have got Cucumber Sync from Play Store only with certain devices (for instance, most Samsung devices)</p>
        
        <h2>2. Accounts may be gone after upgrading Cucumber Sync</h2>
        <p>You may encounter the problem that all your <strong>Cucumber Sync accounts (including contacts and events) when Play Store
        updates Cucumber Sync</strong>. The reason is <a href="https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=66905">another bug in Android</a>
        that causes accounts of paid apps to be removed when upgrading for a similar reason.</p>
        <p>Affected users: some Android 4.4.2 users who have got Cucumber Sync from Play Store (known for Nexus devices and Moto G)</p>
        
        <p><strong>If you\'re affected by one of these bugs, unfortunately there is currently no fix, however a workaround will be implemented before releasing a supported version.</strong></p>

       <h1>Welcome to Cucumber Sync/%s!</h1>
       
       <p>Cucumber Sync is an Android 4+ sync provider that syncs Personal Information Management data Securely (PIMS, like the drink), i.e. contacts and calendars.</p>
       <p>Cucumber Sync uses a self-hosted Mozilla Sync server as the back end, just add a Cucumber Sync account for your Mozilla Sync server and contacts saved using the Cucumber Sync Contacts Provider will be synchronised with the server. Add the Cucumber Sync account to additional devices to synchronise contacts across multiple devices securely.</p>
       
       <p>For more information, please see the <a href="https://github.com/nickel-chrome/CucumberSync">Cucumber Sync site</a> hosted on GitHub.
